# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with their respective symbols (X and O). The player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Files Overview

-    **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the game, including the game board and buttons for player interaction.
-    **style.css**: Defines the styles for the game, including layout, colors, and appearance of the game board and cells.
-    **script.js**: Implements the game logic, handling player moves, checking for a winner, and resetting the game.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells of the grid to place their marks (X or O).
3. The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player gets three marks in a row, they win!

5. Click the reset button to start a new game.
